## Tracking Template

When answering multiple questions, track which companies you've used:

```markdown
<!-- COMPANY TRACKING (do not delete)
Q1: [Company A] - leadership, team coordination
Q2: [Company B] - technical complexity, AI pipeline
Q3: [Company C] - quality improvement, mentoring
Q4: [Company D] - failure, lessons learned
-->
```

## Selection Rules

1. **Never repeat a company** within the same application
2. **Match company to question type** using the tables above
3. **Choose the story with the best metrics** for that company
4. **Consider company size/stage** relative to target company

### Priority Order

If multiple companies could work:

1. Choose the one with the most specific, quantifiable story
2. Choose the one most similar to target company (startup -> startup)
3. Choose the one with the most recent experience
4. Vary between enterprise/startup/solo to show range

For each company, prepare stories following this structure:

```
COMPANY: [Name]

TIMEFRAME: [Years]

BEST FOR: [Question categories]

STORY 1: [Brief title]
