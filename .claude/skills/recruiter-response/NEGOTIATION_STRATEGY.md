# Negotiation Strategy Guide

## Core Principle: Demonstrate Value FIRST

```
WRONG: Ask salary -> Get answer -> Decide to invest effort
RIGHT: Evaluate company -> Invest effort -> Crush assignment -> THEN negotiate
```

**Your leverage is HIGHEST after they want you, not before.**

---

## The Power Dynamic

### Before Demonstrating Value
- You need them (job)
- They have options (other candidates)
- Asking for things = supplicant position

### After Crushing the Assignment
- They want you (proven capability)
- You have leverage (demonstrated value)
- Discussing terms = peer negotiation

---

## Leverage by Stage

| Stage | Your Leverage | What to Do |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| Initial outreach | LOW | Show enthusiasm, demonstrate fit |
| Phone screen | LOW-MEDIUM | Ask about role, not comp |
| Assignment received | MEDIUM | Complete it exceptionally |
| Post-assignment | HIGH | Now discuss compensation |
| Offer stage | HIGHEST | Negotiate from strength |

---

## When TO Ask About Compensation Upfront

Only ask early when:
- Generic recruiter blast with zero specifics
- Contract/hourly/consulting roles
- Large enterprise with structured pay bands
- Job posting explicitly lists range below your floor
- Recruiter asks what you're looking for first

---

## When NOT to Ask About Compensation

Never ask early when:
- Job posting says "competitive", "top of market" comp
- It's an early-stage startup (seed to Series B)
- A founder is reaching out directly
- You haven't demonstrated value yet
- You're genuinely interested in the mission

**Why:**
1. Shows you're more interested in money than the mission
2. Signals transactional mindset (not culture fit)
3. Reveals your hand before you have leverage
4. Puts you in weaker negotiating position

## Assignment Response Strategy

### The High-Velocity Founder Mindset

At startups that "ship weekly" and value builders over talkers:

| DON'T | DO |
|-------|-----|
| Ask scope clarification questions | Just build it |
| Calculate hours out loud | Commit to a deadline |
| Propose alternatives (paid trial, phased) | Show what you can do |
| Signal hesitation | Signal enthusiasm |
| Negotiate before demonstrating value | Crush it, then negotiate |

### Template: Responding to Assignments

```
Thanks for sending this over - I'm excited to dig in.

[Personal context if relevant - creates connection]

I'll have the completed assignment to you by [specific deadline].

Looking forward to showing you what I can build.
```

**Key elements:**
- No questions (just action)
- Specific commitment (deadline)
- Confidence ("what I can build")
- Short and direct (respects their time)

## Assignment Reasonableness Framework

| Assignment Type | Industry Norm | Red Flag Threshold |
|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| System design doc | 1-2 hours | >4 hours |
| Code review exercise | 1-2 hours | >3 hours |
| Small coding challenge | 2-4 hours | >6 hours |
| Prototype/MVP | 4-8 hours | >15 hours |
| Full feature build | 8-15 hours | >20 hours |
| AI/ML startup prototype | 10-20 hours | >40 hours |

### AI Acceleration Factor

With AI assistance (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.), actual time drops 60-85%:

| Raw Estimate | With AI | Effective Investment |
|--------------|---------|---------------------|
| 20 hours | 4-6 hours | Reasonable |
| 40 hours | 8-12 hours | Upper-end but doable |
| 60+ hours | 15+ hours | Consider negotiating |

### ROI Calculation

Before responding, calculate the ROI:

```
Time Investment: [hours with AI assistance]
Potential Outcome: [TC if offered]
ROI: (TC * probability of offer) / hours invested

Example:
- 6 hours prep with AI
- $200K TC role
- 20% offer probability
- ROI: ($200K * 0.20) / 6 = $6,666/hour

If ROI > $500/hour -> Worth the investment
```

## Using Personal Context

Personal touches humanize you and create memorability:

| Context | How to Use |
|---------|------------|
| Major life event | "Quick personal note: [event], so I'll be [brief impact]. That said, I'll have [deliverable] to you by [date]." |
| Relevant experience | Weave into your approach, don't over-explain |
| Genuine enthusiasm | Let it come through in brevity and confidence |

**Why this works:**
- Shows you're a real person, not a resume
- Creates emotional connection
- Demonstrates commitment (will deliver despite life events)
- Memorable

---

## Recovering from Negotiation Mistakes

If you already asked about salary too early:

**DON'T:**
- Re-ask the question
- Point out they didn't answer
- Make it awkward

**DO:**
- Move forward as if you didn't ask
- Focus entirely on demonstrating value
- Let the assignment speak for itself
- Bring up compensation only after they want you

**The key insight:** If they ignored your salary question, they're testing whether you're mission-driven or money-driven. Prove you're mission-driven first.

## Handling Ignored Questions

When recruiters/founders ignore your questions:

| Question Type | If Ignored | What to Do |
|---------------|------------|------------|
| **Salary/comp** | DON'T re-ask | Proceed with demonstrating value |
| **Logistics** | Move forward | Address after they want you |
| **Technical clarifications** | Ask only if blocking | Use judgment and proceed |
| **Role scope** | Use judgment | Proceed with reasonable interpretation |

**When TO re-ask:**
- Safety/legal concerns
- Dealbreaker logistics (must know before investing 20+ hours)
- They explicitly asked you to confirm something

**When NOT to re-ask:**
- Compensation (negotiate later from strength)
- Questions that signal hesitation
- Things you can figure out yourself

---

## Offer Stage Negotiation

Once you have an offer:

### What You Have
- Proven value (they want you)
- Specific numbers on the table
- Leverage to negotiate

### Negotiation Priorities

1. **Base Salary** - Most important, compounds over time
2. **Equity** - Especially at early-stage startups
3. **Signing Bonus** - One-time, easier to negotiate
4. **Title** - Sets trajectory for next role
5. **Start Date** - Take time if needed

### Phrases to Use

- "I'm excited about this role. Can we discuss the compensation?"
- "The base salary is below what I'm targeting. Can we get to [X]?"
- "I have [other option/current compensation] at [X]. Can you match that?"
- "I'd like to think this over. Can I get back to you by [date]?"

### Phrases to Avoid

- "I need..." (sounds desperate)
- "Take it or leave it" (closes negotiation)
- "What's the best you can do?" (leaves money on table)
- "I'll accept if..." (commits you prematurely)

## Summary

1. **Never ask about salary early** if you're genuinely interested
2. **Demonstrate value first** through assignments and interviews
3. **Negotiate from strength** after they want you
4. **Use AI tools** to compress assignment time
5. **Calculate ROI** before declining assignments
6. **Be memorable** through personal context and confidence
