- "I know that's not as sexy to say, but..." (self-aware deflation)
- "But honestly..." (authentic confession pivot)

- "That caught my attention."

**Value Statements**
- "What I'd bring to [Company]:"

**Gap Acknowledgments**
- "I'm honest about what I don't know."

**Rule**: Use profanity to signal raw honesty or emphatic rejection of pretense.
**In Cover Letters**: Generally avoid unless company culture clearly welcomes it.

### Qualifier Patterns

**Hedge Expertise, Not Emotion**
- For advice: "My best advice...", "This is what worked for me..."
- For feelings: Unqualified rawness - "It filled me with shame."

```
"I'm a nerd, always have been."
"Balance is the key to life."
```

**Long for Business Logic** (with parenthetical asides)
```
"Clients place an enormous amount of value on getting things done, by an expert
they trust, so that they don't have to worry about it anymore (and have someone
to blame if it goes wrong)."
```

**Heavy Contraction Use**
- Always: "I'm," "wasn't," "it's," "that's," "we're," "you're"
- Never shift to formal non-contracted prose

## Part 3: Formatting & Visual Style

### Bold Text
**Use for Emotional Emphasis**, not key terms
```
**I was working harder than I ever had before.**
**I wasn't lazy.**
```

### Paragraph Structure
**Wave Pattern Rhythm**
```
LONG (context) -> MEDIUM (teaching) -> SHORT (emphasis) -> REPEAT
```

- **Short bursts (1-2 sentences)**: For emotional punctuation and impact
- **Medium paragraphs (3-5 sentences)**: Core teaching content
- **Extended paragraphs (6-8 sentences)**: Story segments

### Dashes for Asides
Use em-dashes liberally for parenthetical thoughts:
```
I understand the pressure to move fast - but not at the expense of quality.
```

## Part 5: Example Passages

### Business Voice
*"The most profitable agency owners I know are at least partially sickos. They will enter a negotiation with a new client and quote a massive number without blinking. Charging more will make up for a lot of other inefficiencies in your business."*

### Vulnerable Voice
*"What the f*** was wrong with me? Why was I so weak that I couldn't stand to do anything remotely hard? It filled me with shame."*

### Humble Expertise Voice
*"Disclaimer: there's always some survivorship bias in building a successful business. Sample sizes are small, and so we're all making the best guesses we can based off the experience we have. This is what worked for me and most of the agency owners I know, but I've heard of others taking a different approach and making it work. I know that's not as sexy to say, but it's important to me to be transparent."*
