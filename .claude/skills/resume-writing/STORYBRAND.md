# StoryBrand Framework for Resume Creation

## The Fundamental Shift

**Traditional Resume**: "Look at all MY accomplishments" (you as hero)
**StoryBrand Resume**: "Here's how I solve YOUR problems" (employer as hero, you as guide)

## The 7 StoryBrand Elements Applied to Resumes

### 1. A Character (The Employer/Hiring Manager)

The employer is the hero of this story. They have:
- Problems to solve (technical debt, slow delivery, team gaps)
- Goals to achieve (ship faster, scale systems, innovate)
- Fears to overcome (bad hires, project failures, budget overruns)

**In Practice**: Frame everything around what THEY need, not what you've done.

### 2. Has a Problem

Identify three levels of problems from the job description:

| Level | Example | How to Address |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **External** | "We need a full-stack developer" | Match technical requirements |
| **Internal** | "We're frustrated by slow delivery" | Show speed metrics |
| **Philosophical** | "Quality shouldn't take this long" | Demonstrate rapid + quality |

**In Practice**: Your summary should acknowledge their pain before offering solutions.

### 3. Meets a Guide (You)

Position yourself as the experienced guide with:

**Empathy**: "I understand your challenge because I've been there"
- "I understand the pressure to move fast while tech changes overnight"
- "I get that most AI implementations are vaporware"
- "I know the tension between shipping fast and maintaining quality"

**Authority**: "I have the track record to help you succeed"
- Specific metrics and achievements
- Relevant experience at similar companies
- Certifications and credentials

### 4. Who Gives Them a Plan

Provide clarity on how you work:

**Process Plan** (how engagement works):
- "I build production apps in 8-week cycles"
- "I mentor teams while shipping code alongside them"
- "I start with working prototypes, then iterate"

**Agreement Plan** (what they can expect):
- "I deliver the output of an entire team through AI collaboration"
- "I ship code that works in production, not just demos"

### 5. Calls Them to Action

Every section should have implicit or explicit next steps:

**Summary ends with**: "Currently seeking [role type] where I can [value]"
**Experience shows**: Clear progression and availability
**Overall message**: "Let's talk about your challenges"

### 6. That Helps Them Avoid Failure

Paint the picture of what happens WITHOUT you:
- Projects taking 6-8 months instead of 8 weeks
- Paying $100K+ for agencies that deliver vaporware
- Technical debt compounding while competitors ship
- Team velocity declining without proper mentorship

**In Practice**: Your transformation stories show the "before" state they want to avoid.

### 7. And Ends in Success

Show the transformation you create:
- "98% cost reduction" (dramatic improvement)
- "8 weeks from concept to production" (speed)
- "Team velocity increased 30%" (team impact)
- "Platform paid for itself in 6 months" (ROI)

## StoryBrand Professional Summary Template

```
[Role] who helps [type of companies] solve [specific problem] through [your approach].

I understand [their pain point] - I've [empathy statement showing you've been there].

With [X years] experience across [relevant contexts], I've [major achievement demonstrating authority]. I specialize in [technical skills] and have delivered [quantified results].

I build [what you create] that [transformation]. Whether you need [scenario 1], [scenario 2], or [scenario 3], I bring [unique value].

Currently seeking [role type] where I can [value you'll provide].
```

## Transformation Story Formula

Every bullet point should follow: **Problem -> Solution -> Result**

### Template
```
[Problem context] -> [Your action] -> [Measurable outcome]
```

### Examples

**BAD (Self-focused)**:
> Responsible for developing and maintaining web applications using modern technologies.

**GOOD (Employer-focused)**:
> E-commerce platform paying $1,000+/month for limited B2B features -> Built custom Next.js solution in 8 weeks -> Eliminated fees, increased mobile orders 50%, ROI in 6 months.

**BAD (Vague)**:
> Led team to improve application performance significantly.

**GOOD (Specific)**:
> Legacy CSV parser causing 10-minute delays -> Rewrote using dictionaries instead of loops -> Achieved 50x performance improvement, processing in under 15 seconds.

## Voice Guidelines

### Human Phrases (USE)
- Built, Created, Developed, Implemented
- Improved, Reduced, Increased, Optimized
- Led, Managed, Mentored, Coordinated
- "The challenge was...", "The result:", "What I built:"

### AI Buzzwords (AVOID)
- Spearheaded, Pioneered, Leveraged, Utilized
- Synergy, Innovative, Cutting-edge, Revolutionary
- Passionate about, Fostered a culture of
- Game-changing, Disruptive, Best-in-class

### The Read-Aloud Test
Read your resume aloud. If it doesn't sound like something you'd say to a colleague over coffee, rewrite it.
