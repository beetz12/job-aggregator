# 2025 ATS Optimization Best Practices

## Keyword Strategy

### Extraction Process

1. **Copy the entire job description** into analysis
2. **Identify required skills** (must-haves in qualifications)
3. **Note preferred skills** (nice-to-haves, bonus points)
4. **Extract exact phrases** (use their wording, not synonyms)
5. **Prioritize by frequency** (mentioned 3x = high priority)

### Keyword Categories

| Category | Examples | Where to Place |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Hard Skills** | Python, React, AWS, PostgreSQL | Skills section, Experience bullets |
| **Frameworks** | Next.js, TensorFlow, Django | Skills section, Technologies line |
| **Methodologies** | Agile, SCRUM, CI/CD | Core Competencies, Experience |
| **Role Keywords** | "Senior", "Lead", "Architect" | Title, Summary |
| **Industry Terms** | SaaS, B2B, E-commerce | Summary, Experience context |

### Integration Rules

**DO:**
- Use exact phrasing from job description
- Include both full terms AND acronyms: "Large Language Models (LLMs)"
- Place highest-priority keywords in Summary (most weight)
- Repeat key terms 2-3 times across different sections
- Match the exact job title in your headline

**DON'T:**
- Stuff keywords unnaturally
- Use synonyms instead of exact terms
- Hide keywords in white text (instant rejection)
- Repeat same keyword 5+ times (triggers penalties)

## Formatting Requirements

### File Format
- **PDF** (preferred) - preserves formatting
- **DOCX** (acceptable) - some ATS prefer this
- **Never**: Images of text, fancy templates, infographics

### Layout Structure
```
[Single Column Layout]

HEADER (Name, Contact)
|
PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
|
CORE COMPETENCIES (optional skills grid)
|
PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE (reverse chronological)
|
TECHNICAL SKILLS
|
EDUCATION & CERTIFICATIONS
```

### Typography
- **Fonts**: Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman, Garamond, Georgia
- **Size**: 10-12pt body, 14-16pt headers
- **No**: Custom fonts, decorative typefaces, icon fonts

### Section Headers
Use standard, recognizable headers:

| Use This | Not This |
|----------|----------|
| Professional Summary | About Me |
| Professional Experience | Career Journey |
| Technical Skills | Tech Stack |
| Education | Academic Background |
| Certifications | Credentials |

### Avoid These Elements
- Tables (scramble parsing)
- Multi-column layouts (confuse reading order)
- Text boxes (often ignored)
- Images, logos, icons (invisible to ATS)
- Headers/footers (sometimes skipped)
- Graphics, charts, infographics

### Date Format
- **Use**: "Oct 2022 - May 2024" or "October 2022 - May 2024"
- **Include**: City, State/Country for each role
- **Avoid**: Date gaps without explanation

## Content Optimization

### Professional Summary (First 200 words matter most)
- Include target job title
- Top 3-5 keywords from JD
- Years of experience
- Key technical skills
- Unique value proposition

### Experience Section
Each role should include:
- Company name
- Job title (match JD terminology if possible)
- Location (City, State)
- Date range (Month Year - Month Year)
- 4-6 bullet points with keywords

### Bullet Point Formula
```
[Action Verb] + [What You Did] + [Keywords] + [Quantified Result]
```

**Example**:
> Built AI-powered product photography platform using Next.js, Claude, and Supabase, reducing costs by 98% and delivery time from 2-3 weeks to 25 minutes.

### Technical Skills Section
Organize by relevance to job:
```
Languages:     TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, SQL
Frontend:      Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
Backend:       Node.js, Express, FastAPI
AI/ML:         Claude, Gemini, RAG Pipelines, LangChain
Databases:     PostgreSQL, Redis, Supabase
Cloud:         AWS, Vercel, Docker
```

## ATS Scoring Factors

### High Weight (Focus Here)
1. **Job Title Match** - Exact or close match in headline/summary
2. **Required Skills** - All must-have skills present
3. **Experience Level** - Years match requirements
4. **Keyword Density** - Natural integration throughout

### Medium Weight
1. **Education** - Degree requirements met
2. **Certifications** - Relevant credentials
3. **Location** - Geography match (or "Remote")
4. **Preferred Skills** - Nice-to-haves present

### Lower Weight (Still Important)
1. **Company Names** - Recognizable employers
2. **Career Progression** - Logical advancement
3. **Formatting** - Clean, parseable structure
