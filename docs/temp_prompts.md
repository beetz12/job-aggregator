# Claude Code Agent Orchestration patterns
/Users/dave/Work/byterover-app/docs/claude_code_agent

 Ok great Before implementing
  /Users/dave/Work/job-aggregator/docs/plans/FEATURE_INTELLIGENT_JOB_APPLICATION_SYSTEM.md,
  please research 2025 best practices for
   this using Perplexity Deep, and update the plan if needed based on best practices. Also
  since claude computer use is a separate feature, please evaluate if it makes more sense to
  keep it within the same project or to create a new project ( in our current monorepo) So that
  it can be more easily used by other services in the future. please Use your specialized
  multi-agent team to research this in parallel with up to 3 agents and present the updated plan Wait for my approval before further action. If you get this right on the first try, I
  will tip you $200. ultrathink

# add more features
ok perfect. my goal is to build the full stack solution described in @docs/job_aggregator.md. We have already made significant progress by getting the                                                                    
'/Users/dave/Work/job-aggregator/docs/plans/FEATURE_JOB_AGGREGATOR_HACKATHON.md' to work. However, I want to add additional features to get us closer to our goal while leveraging motia from                               
'/Users/dave/Work/job-aggregator/docs/hackathon_info.md'. Please analyze '/Users/dave/Work/job-aggregator/docs/temp_prompts.md' It helped me come up with 5 more features we can implement that will significantly          
enhance the app's utility and value, Whether it's scraping from more sources, Using AI to recommend jobs to candidates, Automatically applying for jobs, or anything else that motia can help us with. Please analyze       
these issues
