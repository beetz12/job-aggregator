Backend Reloaded
> Modern backends shouldn't require juggling frameworks, queues, and services. Motia unifies everything. API endpoints, background jobs, durable workflows, AI agents, streaming, and observability into one runtime with a single core primitive.

> Join Backend Reloaded Hackathon to build next-generation backends that are simpler, faster, and production-ready from the start. Win cash or gift card prizes, exclusive swag, and mentorship opportunities.

> It's time to build backends the way they should be: unified, observable, and effortless.

> Single Core Primitive
Everything unified

Write APIs, background jobs, workflows, and AI agents using one primitive - Steps. Add observability, state management, and streaming without extra configuration. Reduces juggling between different tools and framework.

> Production Ready
Deploy with confidence

Built-in observability, distributed state, durable execution, and real-time streaming. Scale from prototype to production with one command. Resilient by default.
