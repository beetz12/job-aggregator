Backend Reloaded
> Modern backends shouldn't require juggling frameworks, queues, and services. Motia unifies everything. API endpoints, background jobs, durable workflows, AI agents, streaming, and observability into one runtime with a single core primitive.

> Join Backend Reloaded Hackathon to build next-generation backends that are simpler, faster, and production-ready from the start. Win cash or gift card prizes, exclusive swag, and mentorship opportunities.

> It's time to build backends the way they should be: unified, observable, and effortless.

> Single Core Primitive
Everything unified

Write APIs, background jobs, workflows, and AI agents using one primitive - Steps. Add observability, state management, and streaming without extra configuration. Reduces juggling between different tools and framework.

> Production Ready
Deploy with confidence

Built-in observability, distributed state, durable execution, and real-time streaming. Scale from prototype to production with one command. Resilient by default.

> Motia is a unified backend runtime where APIs, background jobs, durable workflows, and AI agents, written in any language live together with built-in observability, state management, streaming, and logging. One runtime. One primitive. One command to production.
>Judging Criteria
>
Real-World Impact: How effectively does your project solve real backend challenges? From automating workflows to building scalable production systems, show us the problem you're solving.
>
Creativity & Innovation: How uniquely do you leverage Motia's unified runtime? Combine APIs, workflows, background jobs, or AI agents in novel ways using Steps as your core primitive.
>
Learning Journey: Demonstrate your problem-solving approach and growth mindset, especially valuable if you're exploring unified backends, durable workflows, or multi-language systems for the first time.
>
Technical Excellence: Quality of implementation matters. We evaluate code quality, workflow efficiency, use of Motia's observability and state features, scalability, and integration depth.
>
Developer Experience: How intuitive is your project? Whether it's API design, workflow visualization, dashboards, or developer tools—polish and usability count.

# rules
Projects should meaningfully use Motia's core model of Steps and Workflows. Using the Motia CLI and showcasing unified flows that tie together APIs, background jobs, scheduled tasks, events, or AI agents will score higher, since that's the heart of Motia.
You must build a new project during the hackathon. Repackaging or lightly modifying an existing project is not allowed.
All design elements, code, and assets for your project must be created during the event. You may use third-party tools, frameworks, open-source libraries, public APIs, and publicly available assets such as Creative Commons images, fonts, datasets, or music.
Teams can plan and discuss ideas in advance, but coding and design work should start only after the hackathon begins. Written notes, sketches, architecture diagrams, and workflow drafts are allowed before kickoff.
Projects must involve building software that runs on Motia as the backend framework. You can mix languages inside one project when it helps your workflow. Hardware components are optional.
Teams may consist of 1–4 members.
Any intellectual property developed during the hackathon belongs to the team that created it. Teams are encouraged to agree internally on IP ownership, though this is not mandatory.
Please treat all participants with respect. Act kindly and professionally. Harassment, discrimination, or exclusionary behavior of any kind will not be tolerated. If you see something concerning, notify an organizer immediately.
Due to legal restrictions, residents or organizations from the following locations are ineligible to participate or receive prizes in the Hackathon: Russia, Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, or any other country or area prohibited by the United States or United States Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control.
Failure to follow these rules or the Code of Conduct may result in disqualification.
