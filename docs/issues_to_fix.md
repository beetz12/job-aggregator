1. when I go to the home page, it shows the job count from each source which is useful but I have no way to see the specific jobs from that source or the jobs from all the sources at once. I need both abilities.
2. When I click on refresh under any job source, it seems to refresh all the sources instead of the source I selected. We also need to add a loading animation / loading widget to show when the refresh is in progress.
3. the source status is showing 0 jobs from dice and wellfound. And google jobs seems to be offline completely. 
4. we are showing 13 sources but our python-scraper actually supports 15 sources - see /Users/dave/Work/python-scraper/Readme.md.
