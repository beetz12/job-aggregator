1. A user can specify the job title and roles he is interested in And as matching jobs are found, The user receives email notification through SendGrid Where the user can click on the link to see the specific job. The user can also go to his dashboard to see all of the matching jobs. 
2. For all of the jobs we retrieve from our job scraper, We should deduplicate and Save only the new jobs in the database. When we call our job scraper api, Should be able to pass in a start date So that we do not have to retrieve all of the jobs that we have already saved to our database. 
3. We should add a feature to research the company and position Based on the user's experience, qualifications, and job preferences to determine if it is a good fit and be able to Generate customized resumes and cover letters for the specific job in question. We already have implemented this as claude skills in '/Users/dave/Work/beetz12/.claude/skills'. These analyze and determine the best way to implement this in our code. I would like to use the claude agent SDK to impelment An intelligent agent that can freely choose which skills to use to implement this and the other new features mentioned below.

We should create a dashboard where the user can see all of the matching jobs suitable to him at a glance, And then he will be able to select the jobs he is interested in and click an additional button called "Check Fit" that will use the skills mentioned above to See if the job is a good fit for him.
